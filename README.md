If your blog content is versioned via Mercurial, this plugin will set articles' and pages' `metadata['date']` and `metadata['modified']` to correspond to that of the hg commit.  This plugin depends on the [`python-hglib` python package](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/PythonHglib).

Installation
------------

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-filetime-from-hg

Usage
-----

The date is determined via the following logic:

* if a file is not tracked by hg, or a file is added but never committed
    * `metadata['date']` = filesystem time
    * `metadata['modified']` = filesystem time
* if a file is tracked, but no changes in working directory
    * `metadata['date']` = first commit time
    * `metadata['modified']` = last commit time
* if a file is tracked, and has changes in working directory
    - `metadata['date']` = first commit time
    - `metadata['modified']` = filesystem time

When this module is enabled, `date` and `modified` will be determined by `hg status`; no need to manually set in article/page metadata. And operations like copy and move will not affect the generated results.

If you don't want a given article or page to use the hg time, set the metadata to `hgtime: off` to disable it.

You can also set `HG_FILETIME_FOLLOW` to `True` in your settings to make the plugin follow file renames â€” i.e., ensure the creation date matches the original file creation date, not the date it was renamed.
